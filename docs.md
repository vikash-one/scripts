Perfect, Vikash! Let‚Äôs now:

1. ‚úÖ Add **Git tagging/versioning**
2. üõ†Ô∏è Add a `Makefile` to run scripts easily
3. ‚öôÔ∏è Set up **GitHub Actions** for Python script linting (with `flake8`)

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Git Versioning with Tags

Use tags to mark releases or stable checkpoints.

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Initial version of Linux and AWS scripts"
git push origin v1.0
```

To list tags later:

```bash
git tag
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 2. `Makefile` for Convenience

Create a file named `Makefile` in the root of your repo:

```Makefile
.PHONY: help lint list-instances cleanup-ebs s3-sync

help:
	@echo "Available targets:"
	@echo "  lint             - Run flake8 linting on python scripts"
	@echo "  list-instances   - Run EC2 instance listing script"
	@echo "  cleanup-ebs      - Run EBS cleanup script"
	@echo "  s3-sync SRC=dir BUCKET=name - Sync folder to S3"

lint:
	flake8 python/

list-instances:
	python python/list_ec2_instances.py

cleanup-ebs:
	python python/ebs_cleanup.py

s3-sync:
	bash bash/aws_s3_sync.sh $(SRC) $(BUCKET)
```

Now you can run:

```bash
make list-instances
make cleanup-ebs
make s3-sync SRC=./data BUCKET=my-bucket-name
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. GitHub Actions for Python Linting

Create the following file:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

Then create `.github/workflows/python-lint.yml`:

```yaml
name: Lint Python Scripts

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'python/**.py'
  pull_request:

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install flake8
        run: pip install flake8

      - name: Run flake8
        run: flake8 python/
```

Push the workflow file:

```bash
git add .github/
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for Python linting"
git push
```

Now GitHub will **automatically lint Python scripts** on every push or pull request.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

You now have:

* ‚úÖ Git versioning via `git tag`
* ‚úÖ A clean `Makefile` to simplify running scripts
* ‚úÖ GitHub Actions CI for linting Python

---

Would you like to:

* Add **ShellCheck** for Bash script linting too?
* Setup `pre-commit` hooks locally?
* Add Terraform or Lambda script templates next?

Happy to extend further.
#*********************************************************************************************
Here‚Äôs a **basic guide to `Makefile`** for scripting use cases ‚Äî perfect for your Bash & Python automation repo.

---

## üîß What is a Makefile?

A `Makefile` is a file used by the `make` command to automate tasks with simple shell commands. Originally for compiling C code, it‚Äôs now widely used to:

* Run scripts
* Lint code
* Sync files
* Automate repetitive CLI tasks

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Simple Structure of a Makefile

```makefile
target-name:
    shell-command-to-run
```

> üí° Use a **tab**, not spaces, before the command under the target.

---

## ‚úÖ Example: Basic Makefile for Your Scripts

```makefile
# List available tasks
help:
	@echo "Usage: make <target>"
	@echo "Available targets:"
	@echo "  list-instances     List EC2 instances using Python"
	@echo "  cleanup-ebs        Delete unused EBS volumes"
	@echo "  s3-sync            Sync a folder to S3 bucket (SRC, BUCKET required)"
	@echo "  lint               Lint Python files using flake8"

# Run EC2 instance listing script
list-instances:
	python python/list_ec2_instances.py

# Run EBS cleanup script
cleanup-ebs:
	python python/ebs_cleanup.py

# Lint all Python scripts
lint:
	flake8 python/

# Sync local folder to S3
s3-sync:
	bash bash/aws_s3_sync.sh $(SRC) $(BUCKET)
```

---

## üèÉ How to Use It

```bash
make help                  # See available commands
make list-instances        # Run EC2 instance lister
make cleanup-ebs           # Run EBS volume cleanup
make lint                  # Lint Python code
make s3-sync SRC=./data BUCKET=my-bucket-name  # Sync data folder to S3
```

---

## üîÅ Variables (Optional)

You can define and reuse variables like this:

```makefile
SCRIPTS_DIR=python

lint:
	flake8 $(SCRIPTS_DIR)/
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

* Always use a **tab**, not spaces, before the command under a target.
* Avoid colons `:` in variable values unless quoting.
* Always check indentation if `make` gives weird errors.

---

Would you like a Makefile template for:

* Terraform commands?
* Lambda build/deploy flow?
* Docker workflow?

Let me know ‚Äî I can tailor it to your stack.
